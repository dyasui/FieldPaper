<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Do Ethnic Enclaves Impede Immigrants’ Integration? Evidence from a Quasi-experimental Social-interaction Approach;,citation_abstract=It is widely debated whether immigrants who live among co-ethnics are less willing to integrate into the host society. Exploiting the quasi-experimental guest worker placement across German regions during the 1960/70s as well as information on immigrants’ inter-ethnic contact networks and social activities, we are able to identify the causal effect of ethnic concentration on social integration. The exogenous placement of immigrants “switches off” observable and unobservable differences in the willingness or ability to integrate which have confounded previous studies. Evidence suggests that the presence of co-ethnics increases migrants’ interaction cost with natives and thus reduces the likelihood of integration.;,citation_author=Alexander M.

To investigate the long‐run economic consequences of this historic episode, I exploit the fact that Hawaiian Japanese were not subject to mass internment. I find that the labor market withdrawal induced by the internment reduced the annual earnings of males by as much as 9%–13% 25 years afterward. This is consistent with the predictions of an economic model that equates the labor market withdrawal induced by the internment with a loss of civilian labor market experience or a loss of advantageous job matches.;,citation_author=Aimee Chin;,citation_publication_date=2005-07;,citation_cover_date=2005-07;,citation_year=2005;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/430285;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1086/430285;,citation_issn=0734-306X;,citation_volume=23;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Labor Economics;">

First, I find strong evidence that refugees with unfavorable unobserved characteristics self‐select into ethnic enclaves. Second, a relative standard deviation increase in the ethnic enclave size increases annual earnings by 18% on average, irrespective of skill level.

Those migrating to low-versus high-mortality regions look similar at baseline, but their subsequent mortality is 0.83–1.01 percentage points lower per percentage point reduction in local mortality, quantifying causal effects of place on mortality among this population.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Imputing Missing Values in the US Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns;,citation_abstract=The County Business Patterns data published by the US Census Bureau track employment by county and industry from 1946 to the present. Two features of the data limit their usefulness to researchers: (1) employment for the majority of county-industry cells is suppressed to protect conﬁdentiality, and (2) industry classiﬁcations change over time. We address both issues. First, we develop a linear programming method that exploits the large set of adding-up constraints implicit in the hierarchical arrangement of the data to impute missing employment. Second, we provide concordances to map all data to a consistent set of industry codes. Finally, we construct a user-friendly, 1975 to 2016 county-level panel that classiﬁes industries according to a consistent set of 2012 NAICS codes in all years.;,citation_author=Fabian Eckert;,citation_author=Teresa C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Immigrating to Opportunity: Estimating the Effect of School Quality Using a Natural Experiment on Ethiopians in Israel*;,citation_abstract=In May 1991 fifteen thousand Ethiopian Jews were brought to Israel in an overnight airlift and sorted in a haphazard and essentially random fashion to absorption centers across the country. This quasi-random assignment produced a natural experiment whereby the initial schooling environment of Ethiopian children can be considered exogenous to their family background and parental decisions. We examine the extent to which the initial elementary school environment affected the high school outcomes of Ethiopian children, using administrative panel data on the educational career of each child in Israel through much of the 1990s. The results show that the early schooling environment has an important effect on high school dropout rates, repetition rates, and the passing rate on matriculation exams necessary to enter college. The results are robust to using alternative measures of the schooling environment and to the inclusion of community fixed effects, which suggests that aspects of the elementary school itself are important for high school success.;,citation_author=Eric D.

We then describe key features of the current refugee crisis and document the overall magnitudes and types of refugee movements, illegal border crossings, and asylum applications to EU member states. We next turn to the economics of refugee migrations, contrasting economic and refugee migrants, discussing the trade-offs between long-term asylum and temporary protection, and highlighting the economic advantages of increasingly coordinating the different national asylum policies. Finally, we illustrate the economic integration of past refugee migrants to EU countries and conclude with several policy recommendations.;,citation_author=Christian Dustmann;,citation_author=Francesco Fasani;,citation_author=Tommaso Frattini;,citation_author=Luigi Minale;,citation_author=Uta Sch;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The economic integration of forced migrants: Evidence for post-war Germany;,citation_abstract=The flight and expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe during and after World War II constitutes one of the largest forced population movements in history. We analyze the economic integration of these forced migrants and their offspring in West Germany. The empirical results suggest that even a quarter of a century after displacement, first generation migrants and native West Germans that were comparable before the war perform strikingly different. Migrants have substantially lower incomes and are less likely to own a house or to be self-employed. Displaced agricultural workers, however, have significantly higher incomes. This income gain can be explained by faster transitions out of low-paid agricultural work. Differences in the labor market performance of second generation migrants resemble those of the first generation.

This higher productivity may occur because more talented individuals sort into large cities, because large cities select more productive entrepreneurs and firms, or because of agglomeration economies. We develop a model of systems of cities that combines all three elements and suggests interesting complementarities between them. The model can replicate stylized facts about sorting, agglomeration, and selection in cities. It also generates Zipf’s law for cities under empirically plausible parameter values.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Forced Displacement and Migrants’ Location Choices: Evidence from the Japanese-Canadian Experience during World War II;,citation_abstract=This paper examines whether a forced displacement of an ethnic group can lead to long-run changes to their spatial distribution and whether this shock can also lead to changes in where new migrants settle. I use the Canadian government’s internment of Japanese Canadians during World War II, as well as their post-war forced resettlement, as a natural experiment. I find that the policy led to dramatic resettlement patterns; areas where Japanese Canadians were removed from had far fewer Japanese Canadians after World War II, with this effect persisting for decades. Despite these displacement patterns, I find that both the pre-war and post-war settlement patterns drive where new Japanese migrants settle within Canada, suggesting that the disruption of the connections and networks formed by Japanese migrants before World War II were not fully dismantled by the Canadian government’s wartime policies. Reinforcing this mechanism, I show using Facebook’s social connectedness data that Japanese population shares from both 1931 and 1951 predict whether a Canadian region is more socially connected with Japan today. The results from this paper show that, despite Canada’s forced dispersal of its Japanese population across the country, networks and forces that connect regions to Japan and draw in new migrants continued to persist.;,citation_author=Jeff Chan;,citation_publication_date=2022-11;,citation_cover_date=2022-11;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4285049;,citation_doi=10.2139/ssrn.4285049;">

We find that earnings of the average worker in a Florida county rises over 4% within the first quarter of being hit by a major Category 4 or 5 hurricane relative to counties not hit, and rises about 1¼% for workers in Florida counties hit by less major Category 1-3 hurricanes. Concomitantly, employment falls between 1½ and 5% depending on hurricane strength. On the other hand, the effects of hurricanes on neighboring counties have the opposite effects, moving earnings down between 3 and 4% in the quarter the hurricane struck. To better examine the specific shocks, we also observe sectoral employment shifts. Finally, we conduct a time-series analysis and find that over time, there is somewhat of a cobweb with earnings and employment rising and falling each quarter over a two-year time period.;,citation_author=Ariel Belasen;,citation_author=Solomon Polachek;,citation_publication_date=2008-04;,citation_cover_date=2008-04;,citation_year=2008;,citation_doi=10.1257/aer.98.2.49;,citation_volume=98;,citation_journal_title=American Economic Review;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Wage Impact of the Marielitos: A Reappraisal;,citation_abstract=This article brings a new perspective to the analysis of the wage effects of the Mariel boatlift crisis, in which an estimated 125,000 Cuban refugees migrated to Florida between April and October, 1980. The author revisits the question of wage impacts from such a supply shock, drawing on the cumulative insights of research on the economic impact of immigration. That literature shows that the wage impact must be measured by carefully matching the skills of the immigrants with those of the incumbent workforce. Given that at least 60% of the Marielitos were high school dropouts, this article specifically examines the wage impact for this low-skill group. This analysis overturns the prior finding that the Mariel boatlift did not affect Miami?s wage structure. The wage of high school dropouts in Miami dropped dramatically, by 10 to 30%, suggesting an elasticity of wages with respect to the number of workers between ?0.5 and ?1.5.;,citation_author=George J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Human Capital Investment and the Internment of Japanese Americans during WWII: A Public Choice Approach;,citation_abstract=On February 19, 1942, U.S. President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which gave final approval to the relocation of Japanese and Japanese-American citizens from the west coast to the interior of the country (Chin, 2005; Caudill and Hill, 1995). The order was signed amid the hysteria following Japan’s late 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. In the process of the internment, many Japanese Americans lost their farms and property. This paper seeks to determine what effect the internment and resulting loss of property had on human capital investments made by Japanese Americans. Economic theory suggests that when returns on other types of capital diminish or become riskier, individuals substitute away from investments in those types of capital and towards investments in human capital. Using large datasets constructed from the 1966 Japanese-American Research Project and the 1960 U.S. Census, empirical results are consistent with the hypothesis that the internment led to increased investments in human capital by Japanese Americans.;,citation_author=Steven B Caudill;,citation_author=Franklin G Mixon;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Early Childhood Conditions and Mortality: Evidence from Japanese American Internment;,citation_abstract=Using War Relocation Authority records linked to the Social Security Death Index, I investigate whether the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII affected the life spans of male internees who were incarcerated during early childhood. Using un-interned Japanese Hawaiians as a control group, difference-in-differences estimates suggest that internees incarcerated within the first four years of life died approximately two years earlier.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Japanese American wages, 1940–1990;,citation_abstract=This dissertation examines the evolution of Japanese American males’ wages relative to those of their white, native-born counterparts. The age-adjusted ratio of their average wages was less than 65% in 1940 and had risen to just over 100% in 1990. Five main questions are addressed: (1) Why were the wages of Japanese Americans so low in 1940 and 1950? (2) How did their relative wages rise so rapidly afterwards? (3) What role did the internment play in the wage gaps from 1950 to 1980? (4) Did internment effects vary by internees’ age at the time of their incarceration? (5) How unique is the Japanese experience in the U.S. labor market? This dissertation finds that large portions of the significant Japanese-white wage gaps before 1980 cannot be explained by differences in measurable characteristics such as years of schooling and experience. The large gaps immediately before and after World War II were due, in large part, to intense discrimination directed at Japanese Americans. As this discrimination abated over time, the wage gap narrowed. The long run effects of internment, including the loss of human capital embodied in three years exclusion from the labor force, adversely affected wages of adolescent internees until at least 1960 and adult internees as late as 1970, contributing to the aggregate wage gap. The evolution of Japanese American wages is shown to be somewhat similar to that of Chinese Americans but different from that of Mexican Americans. The Chinese-white wage gap in 1940 was similar to that for Japanese Americans, also due to the impacts of discriminatory laws and policies directed against them. Although a small wage gap persists, it is attributable to a steady flow of recent immigrants who have not yet assimilated into the U.S. labor market. Recently, U.S.-born Chinese men have had labor market outcomes strikingly similar to those of Japanese men. The Mexican-white wage gap widened throughout the period studied, but most of these gaps are explained by differences in years of schooling.;,citation_author=Molly Malloy Cooper;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/305318361/abstract/D5E3CE614E3F4A60PQ/1;,citation_dissertation_institution=The Ohio State University;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Location, Location, Location;,citation_abstract=We use longitudinal data from the LEHD to study the causal effect of location on earnings. We specify a model for log earnings that includes worker effects and fixed effects for different commuting zones (CZs) fully interacted with industry, allowing us to capture potential impacts of local specialization. Building on recent work on firm-specific wage setting, we show that a simple additive model provides a good approximation to observed changes in log earnings when people move across CZ’s and/or industries, though it takes a couple of quarters for migrants to fully realize the gains of a move. We also show that the earnings premiums for different CZ-industry pairs are nearly separable in industry and CZ, with statistically significant but very small interaction effects. Consistent with recent research from France, Spain and Germany, we find that two thirds of the variation in observed wage premiums for working in different CZs is attributable to skill-based sorting. Using separately estimated models for high and low education workers, we find that the locational premiums for the two groups are very similar. The degree of assortative matching across CZs is much larger for college-educated workers, however, leading to a positive correlation between measured returns to skill and CZ average wages or CZ size that is almost entirely due to sorting on unobserved skills within the college workforce.;,citation_author=David Card;,citation_author=Jesse Rothstein;,citation_author=Moises Yi;,citation_publication_date=2021-10;,citation_cover_date=2021-10;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/cenwpaper/21-32.htm;,citation_technical_report_institution=U.S. Census Bureau, Center for Economic Studies;">

A large amount of evidence suggests that this premium is not just the result of higher ability workers living in cities, which means that cities make workers more productive. Evidence on migrants and the cross effect between urban status and experience implies that a significant fraction of the urban wage premium accrues to workers over time and stays with them when they leave cities.

The model is estimated using panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on white males with a high-school education. Our main conclusion is that interstate migration decisions are influenced to a substantial extent by income prospects.

We evaluate different automated methods for record linkage, performing a series of comparisons across methods and against hand linking. We have three main findings that lead us to conclude that automated methods perform well. First, a number of automated methods generate very low (less than 5 percent) false positive rates. The automated methods trace out a frontier illustrating the trade-off between the false positive rate and the (true) match rate. Relative to more conservative automated algorithms, humans tend to link more observations but at a cost of higher rates of false positives. Second, when human linkers and algorithms use the same linking variables, there is relatively little disagreement between them. Third, across a number of plausible analyses, coefficient estimates and parameters of interest are very similar when using linked samples based on each of the different automated methods.

This policy initiative provides a unique natural experiment, which allows us to estimate the causal effect on labor market outcomes of living in enclaves. We find substantive evidence of sorting across locations. When sorting is taken into account, living in enclaves improves labor market outcomes for less skilled immigrants: the earnings gain associated with a standard deviation increase in ethnic concentration is 13 percent. Furthermore, the quality of the enclave seems to matter.

We develop a spatial equilibrium model that shows how the effect of an immigrant inflow in a district affects local housing prices through changes in how natives perceive the quality of their local amenities and how this influences their mobility. Predictions of the model are tested by using a novel dataset on housing prices and population variables at the district level for a sample of 20 large Italian cities. To address endogeneity problems, we adopt an instrumental variable strategy which uses historical enclaves of immigrants across districts to predict current settlements. We find that immigration raises average house prices at the city level, while it reduces price growth in the district affected by the inflow vis-à-vis the rest of the city. We provide evidence that this pattern is driven by native-flight from immigrant-dense districts towards other areas of the same city.

The survey covers elements of hedonic models, spatial econometrics, neighbourhood models, housing market areas, housing supply, models of segregation, migration, housing tenure, subnational house price modelling including the so-called ripple effect, and agent-based models. Possible future directions are set in the context of a selection of recent papers that have appeared in Urban Studies. Nevertheless, there are still important gaps in the literature that merit further attention, arising at least partly from emerging policy problems.

We find strong evidence that white population flows exhibit tipping-like behavior in most cities, with a distribution of tipping points ranging from 5% to 20% minority share. Tipping is prevalent both in the suburbs and near existing minority enclaves.

This paper estimates a structural spatial equilibrium model to determine causes and welfare consequences of this increased skill sorting. While local labor demand changes fundamentally caused the increased skill sorting, it was further fueled by endogenous increases in amenities within higher skill cities. Changes in cities’ wages, rents, and endogenous amenities increased inequality between high school and college graduates by more than suggested by the increase in the college wage gap alone.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Creating Moves to Opportunity: Experimental Evidence on Barriers to Neighborhood Choice;,citation_abstract=Low-income families in the United States tend to live in neighborhoods that offer limited opportunities for upward income mobility. One potential explanation for this pattern is that families prefer such neighborhoods for other reasons, such as affordability or proximity to family and jobs. An alternative explanation is that they do not move to high-opportunity areas because of a lack of information or barriers that prevent them from making such moves. We test between these explanations using a two- phase randomized controlled trial with housing voucher recipients in Seattle and King County. We first provided a bundle of resources to facilitate moves to high-upward-mobility neighborhoods: information about high-opportunity areas, short-term financial assistance, customized assistance during the housing search process, and connections to landlords. This bundled intervention increased the fraction of families who moved to high-upward-mobility areas from 15% in the control group to 53% in the treatment group. To understand the mechanisms underlying this effect, we ran a second phase with three arms: (1) information about high-opportunity areas and financial assistance only; (2) reduced support services in addition to information and financial assistance; and (3) full support services, as in the original bundled intervention. The full services had five times as large a treatment effect as the information and financial incentives treatment and three times as large an effect as the reduced support intervention, showing that high-intensity, customized support enables moves to opportunity. Interviews with randomly selected families reveal that the program succeeded by relaxing families’ bandwidth constraints and addressing their specific needs, from identifying suitable units to providing emotional support to brokering with landlords. Families induced to move to higher opportunity areas tend to stay in their new neighborhoods in subsequent years and report higher levels of neighborhood satisfaction after moving. Our findings imply that many low-income families do not have a strong preference to stay in low-opportunity areas and that barriers in the housing search process are a central driver of residential segregation by income.;,citation_author=Peter Bergman;,citation_author=Raj Chetty;,citation_author=Stefanie DeLuca;,citation_author=Nathaniel Hendren;,citation_author=Lawrence F.

Examples include treatments capturing spillovers in social and transportation networks, simulated instruments for policy eligibility, and shift-share instruments. We show how exogenous shocks to some, but not all, determinants of such variables can be leveraged while avoiding omitted variables bias. Our solution involves specifying counterfactual shocks that may as well have been realized and adjusting for a summary measure of non-randomness in shock exposure: the average treatment (or instrument) across such counterfactuals. We further show how to use shock counterfactuals for valid finite-sample inference, and characterize the valid instruments that are asymptotically efficient. We apply this framework to address bias when estimating employment effects of market access growth from Chinese high-speed rail construction, and to boost power when estimating coverage effects of expanded Medicaid eligibility.;,citation_author=Kirill Borusyak;,citation_author=Peter Hull;,citation_publication_date=2020-09;,citation_cover_date=2020-09;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w27845;,citation_doi=10.3386/w27845;,citation_publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research;,citation_series_title=Working Paper Series;">

The inflow–causing the population of Spain to grow by 10% between 1998 and 2008–represented a largely new phenomenon, the size of which had not been factored into previous expectations, thereby providing quasi-experimental sources of variance. Our results show that immigrant inflows caused mild native displacement from denser, established neighborhoods, but also more real estate development in these areas. In parallel, both natives and immigrants were collocating in booming suburban communities, resulting in no changes to overall measures of ethnic segregation. In light of the results, we argue that whenever ethnic-minority arrivals spur the creation of new neighborhoods, conventional empirical methods overstate the degree of native flight.;,citation_author=Jesús Fernández-Huertas Moraga;,citation_author=Ada Ferrer-i-Carbonell;,citation_author=Albert Saiz;,citation_publication_date=2019-07;,citation_cover_date=2019-07;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119019300476;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jue.2019.06.002;,citation_issn=0094-1190;,citation_volume=112;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Urban Economics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Gift of Moving: Intergenerational Consequences of a Mobility Shock;,citation_abstract=We exploit a volcanic “experiment” to study the costs and beneﬁts of geographic mobility. In our experiment, a third of the houses in a town were covered by lava. People living in these houses were much more likely to move away permanently. For the dependents in a household (children), our estimates suggest that being induced to move by the “lava shock” dramatically raised lifetime earnings and education. While large, these estimates come with a substantial amount of statistical uncertainty. The beneﬁts of moving were very unequally distributed across generations: the household heads (parents) were made slightly worse off by the shock. These results suggest large barriers to moving for the children, which imply that labour does not ﬂow to locations where it earns the highest returns. The large gains from moving for the young are surprising in light of the fact that the town affected by our volcanic experiment was (and is) a relatively high income town. We interpret our ﬁndings as evidence of the importance of comparative advantage: the gains to moving may be very large for those badly matched to the location they happened to be born in, even if differences in average income are small.;,citation_author=Emi Nakamura;,citation_author=Jósef Sigurdsson;,citation_author=Jón Steinsson;,citation_publication_date=2022-05;,citation_cover_date=2022-05;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/89/3/1557/6372705;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1093/restud/rdab062;,citation_issn=0034-6527, 1467-937X;,citation_volume=89;,citation_journal_title=The Review of Economic Studies;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=When are ghettos bad? Lessons from immigrant segregation in the United States;,citation_abstract=Recent studies provide conflicting evidence on the connection between ethnic or racial neighborhood segregation and outcomes. Some studies find that residence in an enclave is beneficial, some reach the opposite conclusion, and still others imply that any relationship is small. One hypothesis is that studies differ because the impact of segregation varies across groups, perhaps because its impact is more benign for better-educated groups. This paper presents new evidence on this hypothesis using data on first-generation immigrants in the United States. We confront the endogenous selection into residential enclaves and find that selection into enclave neighborhoods is on balance negative. Correcting for this selection produces positive mean effects of segregation, and a positive correlation between group average human capital and the impact of segregation.;,citation_author=David M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Immigrant Enclaves and Ethnic Communities in New York and Los Angeles;,citation_abstract=The predominant post–1965 immigrant groups have established distinctive settlement areas in many American cities and suburbs. These areas are generally understood in terms of an “immigrant enclave” model in which ethnic neighborhoods in central cities serve relatively impoverished new arrivals as a potential base for eventual spatial assimilation with the white majority. This model, and the “ethnic community “ model, are evaluated here. In the ethnic community model, segregated settlement can result from group preferences even when spatial assimilation is otherwise feasible. Analysis of the residential patterns of the largest immigrant groups in New York and Los Angeles shows that most ethnic neighborhoods can be interpreted as immigrant enclaves. In some cases, however, living in ethnic neighborhoods is unrelated to economic constraints, indicating a positive preference for such areas. Suburban residence does not necessarily imply living outside of ethnic neighborhoods. Indeed, for several groups the suburban enclave provides an alternative to assimilation—it is an ethnic community in a relatively high-status setting.;,citation_author=John R.

The richness of the data allows us to compute the indices across different provinces and over time. Segregation levels show high variation across the country, with significantly lower levels of segregation in provinces with a higher share of refugees. Refugee mobility across provinces over time appears to be negatively correlated with segregation at destination, while native mobility is not. Based on data from Istanbul, segregation does not influence intra-province mobility. This is possibly due to the differences in segregation indices across the hours of the day, suggesting that residential segregation is higher than labor market segregation.;,citation_author=Simone Bertoli;,citation_author=Caglar Ozden;,citation_author=Michael Packard;,citation_publication_date=2021-09;,citation_cover_date=2021-09;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387821000791;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2021.102704;,citation_issn=0304-3878;,citation_volume=152;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Development Economics;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Understanding Migration Responses to Local Shocks;,citation_abstract=We examine how to interpret estimates from a commonly used migration regression relating changes in local population to exogenous local labor demand shocks. Using a simple model of local labor markets with mobility costs, we find that most conclusions drawn from migration regression estimates are likely to be substantially misleading. Intuitively, the conventional migration regression is misspecified due to the bilateral nature of location choices. Workers choose where to live based not only on the shock to their current location, but also on the shocks to potential alternative locations, which are omitted from the regression. Analytical results and simulations based on Brazilian data show that conventional migration regression estimates are inaccurate for the local population effects of either shocks to individual locations or all observed shocks taken together and often substantially understate the amount of worker reallocation driven by observed shocks. These problems are particularly acute when workers face industry switching costs in addition to geographic mobility costs. Simple alternative approaches leveraging the model’s structure exhibit far better performance.;,citation_author=Kirill Borusyak;,citation_author=Rafael Dix-Carneiro;,citation_author=Brian Kovak;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=4086847;,citation_doi=10.2139/ssrn.4086847;,citation_issn=1556-5068;,citation_journal_title=SSRN Electronic Journal;">

<section id="population-and-migration" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="population-and-migration">Population and Migration</h2>
<p>For long-run migration data, I use the Decennial Census data provided by the US Census Bureau via the <a href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml">Integrated Public Use Microdata Series</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="ruggles_steven_ipums_2020">(<a href="#ref-ruggles_steven_ipums_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ruggles, Steven et al. 2020</a>)</span>. The census samples for which county locations are available include the 1940, 1950, 1980, and 1990 1% samples, the 1960 5% sample, and the 1970 Form 1 Metro 1% sample.</p>
<p>For the calculation of migration rates between counties, I define a migrant as someone who reports that they either moved within the state, between states, or that they were abroad five years ago (or in the past 1 year for 1960 respondants). This excludes people who report moving within the same house, didn’t report their previous location, or the location is unknown.</p>

<section id="geography" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Locations for historical interment camp locations were archived by <a href="http://encyclopedia.densho.org/War_Relocation_Authority/#Planning_the_Camps">Densho Encyclopedia</a> and downloaded in csv form via the <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=69183af8d45d4f46a9dc4eba99440891">Behind Barbed Wires story project</a>.</p>
<!-- I also use 1950 county boundaries derived from 2008 TIGER/line files -->
<!-- dowloaded from [https://www.nhgis.org/data-availability#gis-files](NHGIS) -->
<!-- [@manson_steven_national_2022]. -->
<p>Although most county borders did not change much in the second half of the 20th Century, there were counties which split, merged, or had name changes which can make cross-decade comparisons difficult. For these reasons, I choose to standardize the set of counties in my analysis to the set of counties as they appear in the year 1990. To map historical county-level data to 1990 county definitions, I implement the crosswalk method by <span class="citation" data-cites="eckert_method_2020">(<a href="#ref-eckert_method_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Eckert et al. 2020</a>)</span>. They overlay historical county boundary shapefiles from <a href="NHGIS">https://www.nhgis.org/</a> onto county boundaries for a specific target year (in this case 1990). The sub-areas created by these overlays are used to calculate a set of geographic weights which represent the fractions of a 1990 county’s area which were within the geographic areas of counties as they appear in different decades (specifically the decades between and including 1940 to 1980). For my analysis, I take the crosswalk weights from the example csv file for the end year 1990 which is published on the authors’ <a href="https://github.com/liang-jack-a/EGLP_Crosswalk/tree/master">github repository</a>.</p>
<p>I calculate the straight line distances in meters between each 1950 county centroid to each camp location in QGIS with the <code>Distance Matrix</code> tool using the Standard (N x T) distance matrix setting.</p>
</section>
<section id="historical-counties-dataset" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="historical-counties-dataset">Historical counties dataset</h2>
<p>After narrowing down to counties which can be observed in each census year and then translating the historical counties to 1990 county boundaries, I am left with 3082 counties with observable migration rates in 1940, 108 in 1950, 410 in 1960, 115 in 1970, 254 in 1980, and 290 in 1990.</p>
<p>My primary dataset is therefore a pooled-crossection with a total number of 20 county-year level observations. Each observation represents an individual county at a given year in time if it had the same borders as it had in 1990.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau confidentiality standards state that public-use microdata will cannot show report locations with populations of less than 100,000 people <span class="citation" data-cites="federal_committee_on_statistical_methodology_statistical_2005">(<a href="#ref-federal_committee_on_statistical_methodology_statistical_2005" role="doc-biblioref">Statistical Methodology 2005</a>)</span>.</p>
