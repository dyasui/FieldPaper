  abstract = {The National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) provides free online access to summary statistics and GIS boundary files for U.S. censuses and other nationwide surveys from 1790 through the present. GIS files include: counties and states since 1790, census tracts since 1910, metropolitan areas since 1950, place and county subdivision boundaries since 1980, place points since 1900, all standard census reporting areas since 1990, centers of population for four geographic levels since 2000, and SABINS school attendance areas for 2009-12. Summary tables from decennial censuses and the American Community Survey include county and state tables since 1790; census tract tables since 1910; and tables for all original census summary levels, down to census blocks, since 1970. Additional summary tables include County Business Patterns data (annual, 1970-2002), vital statistics for counties and states (births and deaths: annual, 1915-2007; marriages and divorces: selected years, 1867-2010), agricultural census data (1840-1950), religious bodies data (1850-1952), manufacturing census data (1840-1940), and 2010 census data for SABINS school attendance areas. NHGIS also includes time series tables providing comparable statistics from multiple source years with standardized categories and geography; geographic crosswalks summarizing associations between 1990-2020 census geographic units; environmental summaries describing climate characteristics by county and land cover by county and census tract; and privacy-protected demonstration data that link original 2010 census summary data with data derived from trial runs of the Census Bureau's new 2020 Disclosure Avoidance System applied to 2010 Census responses. NHGIS data are available through an online access system and API and are offered free of charge to registered users at https://nhgis.org.},

  abstract = {Recent immigrants tend to locate in ethnic ``enclaves'' within metropolitan areas. The economic consequence of living in such enclaves is still an unresolved issue. We use data from an immigrant policy initiative in Sweden, when government authorities distributed refugee immigrants across locales in a way that we argue is exogenous. This policy initiative provides a unique natural experiment, which allows us to estimate the causal effect on labor market outcomes of living in enclaves. We find substantive evidence of sorting across locations. When sorting is taken into account, living in enclaves improves labor market outcomes for less skilled immigrants: the earnings gain associated with a standard deviation increase in ethnic concentration is 13 percent. Furthermore, the quality of the enclave seems to matter. Members of high-income ethnic groups gain more from living in an enclave than members of low-income ethnic groups.},

  abstract = {This paper examines whether a forced displacement of an ethnic group can lead to long-run changes to their spatial distribution and whether this shock can also lead to changes in where new migrants  settle. I use the Canadian government's internment of Japanese Canadians during World War II, as well as their post-war forced resettlement, as a natural experiment. I find that the policy led to dramatic resettlement patterns; areas where Japanese Canadians were removed from had far fewer Japanese Canadians after World War II, with this effect persisting for decades. Despite these displacement patterns, I find that both the pre-war and post-war settlement patterns drive where new Japanese migrants settle within Canada, suggesting that the disruption of the connections and networks formed by Japanese migrants before World War II were not fully dismantled by the Canadian government's wartime policies. Reinforcing this mechanism, I show using Facebook's social connectedness data that Japanese population shares from both 1931 and 1951 predict whether a Canadian region is more socially connected with Japan today. The results from this paper show that, despite Canada's forced dispersal of its Japanese population across the country, networks and forces that connect regions to Japan and draw in new migrants continued to persist.},

  abstract = {In this article, I jointly investigate the political and the economic effects of immigration, and study the causes of anti-immigrant sentiments. I exploit exogenous variation in European immigration to U.S. cities between 1910 and 1930 induced by World War I and the Immigration Acts of the 1920s, and instrument immigrants' location decision relying on pre-existing settlement patterns. I find that immigration triggered hostile political reactions, such as the election of more conservative legislators, higher support for anti-immigration legislation, and lower redistribution. Exploring the causes of natives' backlash, I document that immigration increased natives' employment, spurred industrial production, and did not generate losses even among natives working in highly exposed sectors. These findings suggest that opposition to immigration was unlikely to have economic roots. Instead, I provide evidence that natives' political discontent was increasing in the cultural differences between immigrants and natives. Results in this article indicate that, even when diversity is economically beneficial, it may nonetheless be socially hard to manage.},

Finally, we discuss evidence on the efficacy of policies aimed at encouraging migration and conclude by highlighting important unanswered questions that are critical for informing migration-related policy.},
