## Research Question

  * Did post-war relocation cause a permanent shift in the migration choices of Japanese Americans?

---


## Motivation

  * Immigrant populations tend to concentrate near places of initial settlement
    
  * Integration/assimilation could be important for immigrant labor market outcomes

    - [@edin_ethnic_2003]
  
  * Evidence for Canadian Japanese internment having persistant
effect on spatial Japanese distribution

  - Digitized and uploaded by Cooper Thomas via [data.world](https://data.world/infinitecoop/japanese-internment-camps)

* Decennial Census Data for years 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990
  - Via IPUMS USA [@ruggles_steven_ipums_2020]

* 1950 county boundary shapefiles from NHGIS

## Discussion

* Similar to [@chan_forced_2022]'s findings for Japanese Canadians,
I find areas which received more Japanese internees experienced 
higher rates of later immigration by other Japanese Americans

* However, the differences between 'treated' counties which were recipients of 
internees and not subject to evacuation, and 'control' counties which did not receive internees 
are not statistically significant.
---

## Discussion
* Other potentially relevant US factors:
  - US occupation of Japan 1945-1952 and Japanese 'war brides'
  - Potentially less harsh treatment compared to Japanese Canadians
    + Canadian government explicit policy of appropriation of property
---

## Next Steps

* Include controls for other demographics: age, gender, citizenship
* Look for evidence of possible cultural transmission in treated counties
  - Facebook connections data
  - Immigration attractiveness to other ethnic groups
