	abstract = {It is widely debated whether immigrants who live among co-ethnics are less willing to integrate into the host society. Exploiting the quasi-experimental guest worker placement across German regions during the 1960/70s as well as information on immigrants' inter-ethnic contact networks and social activities, we are able to identify the causal effect of ethnic concentration on social integration. The exogenous placement of immigrants ‘switches off’ observable and unobservable differences in the willingness or ability to integrate which have confounded previous studies. Evidence suggests that the presence of co-ethnics increases migrants' interaction cost with natives and thus reduces the likelihood of integration.},

We address both issues.

Second, we provide concordances to map all data to a consistent set of industry codes. Finally, we construct a user-friendly, 1975 to 2016 county-level panel that classiﬁes industries according to a consistent set of 2012 NAICS codes in all years.},

This quasi-random assignment produced a natural experiment whereby the initial schooling environment of Ethiopian children can be considered exogenous to their family background and parental decisions. We examine the extent to which the initial elementary school environment affected the high school outcomes of Ethiopian children, using administrative panel data on the educational career of each child in Israel through much of the 1990s. The results show that the early schooling environment has an important effect on high school dropout rates, repetition rates, and the passing rate on matriculation exams necessary to enter college. The results are robust to using alternative measures of the schooling environment and to the inclusion of community fixed effects, which suggests that aspects of the elementary school itself are important for high school success.},

We analyze the economic integration of these forced migrants and their offspring in West Germany. The empirical results suggest that even a quarter of a century after displacement, first generation migrants and native West Germans that were comparable before the war perform strikingly different. Migrants have substantially lower incomes and are less likely to own a house or to be self-employed. Displaced agricultural workers, however, have significantly higher incomes. This income gain can be explained by faster transitions out of low-paid agricultural work. Differences in the labor market performance of second generation migrants resemble those of the first generation. We also find that displacement considerably weakens the intergenerational transmission of human capital between fathers and children, especially at the lower tail of the skill distribution},

I use the Canadian government's internment of Japanese Canadians during World War II, as well as their post-war forced resettlement, as a natural experiment. I find that the policy led to dramatic resettlement patterns; areas where Japanese Canadians were removed from had far fewer Japanese Canadians after World War II, with this effect persisting for decades. Despite these displacement patterns, I find that both the pre-war and post-war settlement patterns drive where new Japanese migrants settle within Canada, suggesting that the disruption of the connections and networks formed by Japanese migrants before World War II were not fully dismantled by the Canadian government's wartime policies. Reinforcing this mechanism, I show using Facebook's social connectedness data that Japanese population shares from both 1931 and 1951 predict whether a Canadian region is more socially connected with Japan today. The results from this paper show that, despite Canada's forced dispersal of its Japanese population across the country, networks and forces that connect regions to Japan and draw in new migrants continued to persist.},

Concomitantly, employment falls between 1½ and 5\% depending on hurricane strength. On the other hand, the effects of hurricanes on neighboring counties have the opposite effects, moving earnings down between 3 and 4\% in the quarter the hurricane struck. To better examine the specific shocks, we also observe sectoral employment shifts.

	abstract = {On February 19, 1942, U.S. President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which gave final approval to the relocation of Japanese and Japanese-American citizens from the west coast to the interior of the country (Chin, 2005; Caudill and Hill, 1995). The order was signed amid the hysteria following Japan’s late 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. In the process of the internment, many Japanese Americans lost their farms and property. This paper seeks to determine what effect the internment and resulting loss of property had on human capital investments made by Japanese Americans. Economic theory suggests that when returns on other types of capital diminish or become riskier, individuals substitute away from investments in those types of capital and towards investments in human capital. Using large datasets constructed from the 1966 Japanese-American Research Project and the 1960 U.S. Census, empirical results are consistent with the hypothesis that the internment led to increased investments in human capital by Japanese Americans.},

Using un-interned Japanese Hawaiians as a control group, difference-in-differences estimates suggest that internees incarcerated within the first four years of life died approximately two years earlier. Furthermore, the internees from low socioeconomic status families and internees incarcerated in cold climates drive almost the entire effect. Additionally, NCHS cause-of-death data suggest that early childhood incarceration increased the incidence of circulatory diseases by 7 percentage points. Data on Chinese Americans suggest that the identifying assumption is satisfied.},

	abstract = {This dissertation examines the evolution of Japanese American males' wages relative to those of their white, native-born counterparts. The age-adjusted ratio of their average wages was less than 65\% in 1940 and had risen to just over 100\% in 1990. Five main questions are addressed: (1) Why were the wages of Japanese Americans so low in 1940 and 1950? (2) How did their relative wages rise so rapidly afterwards? (3) What role did the internment play in the wage gaps from 1950 to 1980? (4) Did internment effects vary by internees' age at the time of their incarceration? (5) How unique is the Japanese experience in the U.S. labor market?
This dissertation finds that large portions of the significant Japanese-white wage gaps before 1980 cannot be explained by differences in measurable characteristics such as years of schooling and experience. The large gaps immediately before and after World War II were due, in large part, to intense discrimination directed at Japanese Americans. As this discrimination abated over time, the wage gap narrowed. The long run effects of internment, including the loss of human capital embodied in three years exclusion from the labor force, adversely affected wages of adolescent internees until at least 1960 and adult internees as late as 1970, contributing to the aggregate wage gap.
The evolution of Japanese American wages is shown to be somewhat similar to that of Chinese Americans but different from that of Mexican Americans. The Chinese-white wage gap in 1940 was similar to that for Japanese Americans, also due to the impacts of discriminatory laws and policies directed against them. Although a small wage gap persists, it is attributable to a steady flow of recent immigrants who have not yet assimilated into the U.S. labor market. Recently, U.S.-born Chinese men have had labor market outcomes strikingly similar to those of Japanese men. The Mexican-white wage gap widened throughout the period studied, but most of these gaps are explained by differences in years of schooling.},

Originally published as a report of the Western Archeological and Conservation Center of the National Park Service, it is now reissued in a corrected edition, with a new Foreword by Tetsuden Kashima, associate professor of American ethnic studies at the University of Washington.   Based on archival research, field visits, and interviews with former residents, Confinement and Ethnicity provides an overview of the architectural remnants, archeological features, and artifacts remaining at the various sites. Included are numerous maps, diagrams, charts, and photographs. Historic images of the sites and their inhabitants -- including several by Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams -- are combined with photographs of present-day settings, showing concrete foundations, fence posts, inmate-constructed drainage ditches, and foundations and parts of buildings, as well as inscriptions in Japanese and English written or scratched on walls and rocks. The result is a unique and poignant treasure house of information for former residents and their descendants, for Asian American and World War II historians, and for anyone interested in the facts about what the authors call these �sites of shame.�},

We specify a model for log earnings that includes worker effects and fixed effects for different commuting zones (CZs) fully interacted with industry, allowing us to capture potential impacts of local specialization. Building on recent work on firm-specific wage setting, we show that a simple additive model provides a good approximation to observed changes in log earnings when people move across CZ’s and/or industries, though it takes a couple of quarters for migrants to fully realize the gains of a move. We also show that the earnings premiums for different CZ-industry pairs are nearly separable in industry and CZ, with statistically significant but very small interaction effects. Consistent with recent research from France, Spain and Germany, we find that two thirds of the variation in observed wage premiums for working in different CZs is attributable to skill-based sorting. Using separately estimated models for high and low education workers, we find that the locational premiums for the two groups are very similar. The degree of assortative matching across CZs is much larger for college-educated workers, however, leading to a positive correlation between measured returns to skill and CZ average wages or CZ size that is almost entirely due to sorting on unobserved skills within the college workforce.},

important determinant of children's long-term outcomes. (JEL I31,

The model is estimated using panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on white males with a high-school education. Our main conclusion is that interstate migration decisions are influenced to a substantial extent by income prospects. The results suggest that the link between income and migration decisions is driven both by geographic differences in mean wages and by a tendency to move in search of a better locational match when the income realization in the current location is unfavorable.},

main findings that lead us to conclude that automated methods perform well. First, a number of automated methods generate very low (less than 5 percent) false positive rates. The automated 
methods trace out a frontier illustrating the trade-off between the false positive rate and the (true) match rate. Relative to more conservative automated algorithms, humans tend to link more 
observations but at a cost of higher rates of false positives. Second, when human linkers and algorithms use the same linking variables, there is relatively little disagreement between them. 
Third, across a number of plausible analyses, coefficient estimates and parameters of interest are very similar when using linked samples based on each of the different automated methods. We 
provide code and Stata commands to implement the various automated methods.},

This policy initiative provides a unique natural experiment, which allows us to estimate the causal effect on labor market outcomes of living in enclaves. We find substantive evidence of sorting across locations. When sorting is taken into account, living in enclaves improves labor market outcomes for less skilled immigrants: the earnings gain associated with a standard deviation increase in ethnic concentration is 13 percent. Furthermore, the quality of the enclave seems to matter. Members of high-income ethnic groups gain more from living in an enclave than members of low-income ethnic groups.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a model of spatial segregation mediated by competitive land prices. Agents of two groups consume city land and benefit from social interactions. Because of cultural or ethnic differences, intragroup interactions are more frequent than intergroup ones. When group sizes differ, population groups sort into distinct neighborhoods. We characterize two- and three-district urban structures. For high population ratios or strong intergroup interactions, only a three-district city exists. In other cases, multiplicity of equilibria arises. Both groups generally rank these equilibria differently. However, when group sizes are similar, all individuals agree on which spatial equilibrium is best.},

We develop a spatial equilibrium model that shows how the effect of an immigrant inflow in a district affects local housing prices through changes in how natives perceive the quality of their local amenities and how this influences their mobility. Predictions of the model are tested by using a novel dataset on housing prices and population variables at the district level for a sample of 20 large Italian cities. To address endogeneity problems, we adopt an instrumental variable strategy which uses historical enclaves of immigrants across districts to predict current settlements. We find that immigration raises average house prices at the city level, while it reduces price growth in the district affected by the inflow vis-à-vis the rest of the city. We provide evidence that this pattern is driven by native-flight from immigrant-dense districts towards other areas of the same city. These findings are consistent with a negative effect of immigrants on native's perceived local amenities.},

The survey also points to some of the more promising future directions for the subject that are beginning to appear in the literature. The survey covers elements of hedonic models, spatial econometrics, neighbourhood models, housing market areas, housing supply, models of segregation, migration, housing tenure, subnational house price modelling including the so-called ripple effect, and agent-based models. Possible future directions are set in the context of a selection of recent papers that have appeared in Urban Studies. Nevertheless, there are still important gaps in the literature that merit further attention, arising at least partly from emerging policy problems. These include more research on housing and biodiversity, the relationship between housing and civil unrest, the effects of changing age distributions – notably housing for the elderly – and the impact of different international institutional structures. Methodologically, developments in Big Data provide an exciting framework for future work.},

We use regression discontinuity methods and Census tract data from 1970 through 2000 to test for discontinuities in the dynamics of neighborhood racial composition. We find strong evidence that white population flows exhibit tipping-like behavior in most cities, with a distribution of tipping points ranging from 5\% to 20\% minority share. Tipping is prevalent both in the suburbs and near existing minority enclaves. In contrast to white population flows, there is little evidence of nonlinearities in rents or housing prices around the tipping point. Tipping points are higher in cities where whites have more tolerant racial attitudes.},

Locational changes, not negative selection of families, explain lower upward mobility, with persistent segregation and increased crime and policing as plausible mechanisms.

	abstract = {Low-income families in the United States tend to live in neighborhoods that offer limited opportunities for upward income mobility. One potential explanation for this pattern is that families prefer such neighborhoods for other reasons, such as affordability or proximity to family and jobs. An alternative explanation is that they do not move to high-opportunity areas because of a lack of information or barriers that prevent them from making such moves. We test between these explanations using a two- phase randomized controlled trial with housing voucher recipients in Seattle and King County. We first provided a bundle of resources to facilitate moves to high-upward-mobility neighborhoods: information about high-opportunity areas, short-term financial assistance, customized assistance during the housing search process, and connections to landlords. This bundled intervention increased the fraction of families who moved to high-upward-mobility areas from 15\% in the control group to 53\% in the treatment group. To understand the mechanisms underlying this effect, we ran a second phase with three arms: (1) information about high-opportunity areas and financial assistance only; (2) reduced support services in addition to information and financial assistance; and (3) full support services, as in the original bundled intervention. The full services had five times as large a treatment effect as the information and financial incentives treatment and three times as large an effect as the reduced support intervention, showing that high-intensity, customized support enables moves to opportunity. Interviews with randomly selected families reveal that the program succeeded by relaxing families' bandwidth constraints and addressing their specific needs, from identifying suitable units to providing emotional support to brokering with landlords. Families induced to move to higher opportunity areas tend to stay in their new neighborhoods in subsequent years and report higher levels of neighborhood satisfaction after moving. Our findings imply that many low-income families do not have a strong preference to stay in low-opportunity areas and that barriers in the housing search process are a central driver of residential segregation by income.},

We further show how to use shock counterfactuals for valid finite-sample inference, and characterize the valid instruments that are asymptotically efficient. We apply this framework to address bias when estimating employment effects of market access growth from Chinese high-speed rail construction, and to boost power when estimating coverage effects of expanded Medicaid eligibility.},

Our results show that immigrant inflows caused mild native displacement from denser, established neighborhoods, but also more real estate development in these areas. In parallel, both natives and immigrants were collocating in booming suburban communities, resulting in no changes to overall measures of ethnic segregation. In light of the results, we argue that whenever ethnic-minority arrivals spur the creation of new neighborhoods, conventional empirical methods overstate the degree of native flight.},

Using a simple model of local labor markets with mobility costs, we find that most conclusions drawn from migration regression estimates are likely to be substantially misleading. Intuitively, the conventional migration regression is misspecified due to the bilateral nature of location choices. Workers choose where to live based not only on the shock to their current location, but also on the shocks to potential alternative locations, which are omitted from the regression. Analytical results and simulations based on Brazilian data show that conventional migration regression estimates are inaccurate for the local population effects of either shocks to individual locations or all observed shocks taken together and often substantially understate the amount of worker reallocation driven by observed shocks. These problems are particularly acute when workers face industry switching costs in addition to geographic mobility costs. Simple alternative approaches leveraging the model’s structure exhibit far better performance.},

	abstract = {Empirical researchers often have to map data provided for a "reporting" spatial unit, say counties in 1900, to a "reference" one, say, counties in 2010. We discuss a general method to create such crosswalks: computing the share of the area of each reporting unit nested in a given reference unit. Using these shares, data can be re-aggregated from the reporting to the reference units. We apply the method to construct a crosswalk for US county-level data since 1790 to present-day counties or commuting zones. We also provide the code to generate other crosswalks given maps of reporting and reference units.},

Summary tables from decennial censuses and the American Community Survey include county and state tables since 1790; census tract tables since 1910; and tables for all original census summary levels, down to census blocks, since 1970. Additional summary tables include County Business Patterns data (annual, 1970-2002), vital statistics for counties and states (births and deaths: annual, 1915-2007; marriages and divorces: selected years, 1867-2010), agricultural census data (1840-1950), religious bodies data (1850-1952), manufacturing census data (1840-1940), and 2010 census data for SABINS school attendance areas. NHGIS also includes time series tables providing comparable statistics from multiple source years with standardized categories and geography; geographic crosswalks summarizing associations between 1990-2020 census geographic units; environmental summaries describing climate characteristics by county and land cover by county and census tract; and privacy-protected demonstration data that link original 2010 census summary data with data derived from trial runs of the Census Bureau�s 2020 Disclosure Avoidance System applied to 2010 Census responses.

	abstract = {In 1942 more than 110,000 persons of Japanese origin living on the U.S. West Coast were forcibly sent away to ten internment camps for one to three years. This paper studies how internees’ careers were affected in the long run. Combining Census data, camp records, and survey data, I develop a predictor of a person’s internment status based on Census observables. Using a difference-in-differences framework, I find that internment had long-run positive effects on earnings. The evidence is consistent with mechanisms related to increased mobility due to re-optimization of occupation and location choices, possibly facilitated by camps’ high economic diversity.},

	abstract = {Someone who lives in an economically depressed place was probably born there. And having workers with local ties who prefer to live in their birthplaces leads to smaller migration responses in depressed places. Smaller migration responses lead to lower real incomes and make incomes more volatile, a form of hysteresis. Local ties can also persist for generations. Subsidies to economically depressed places cause smaller distortions, because few people want to move to depressed places. Finally, subsidies to productive places increase aggregate productivity, as they induce more migration.},
